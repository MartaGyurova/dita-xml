    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Here you will learn more about what a Server on Discord is.</p>
        <p class="p">Discord allows its users to make communities, which can message or talk to each other.
            Each community is a <strong class="ph b">server</strong>. You can write to people via text channels or talk to
            them via voice channels.</p>
        <p class="p">Starting your own server, or joining someone else's server, is free.</p>
        <p class="p">If you have interest in something, you can probably find a Discord server for it and talk
            to people who also share the same interest as you.</p>
        <p class="p">Every server can have multiple different channels, dedicated to a specific topic. </p>
        <p class="p">For example: You can have a channel for cat gifs, a separate channel for gaming, a third
            for tv-shows and so on.</p>
        <p class="p">In the picture below you can see a server with 3 text channels, one of which is dedicated
            only for gifs of cats.</p>
